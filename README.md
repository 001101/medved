# MÃ¨dved

This is a web-based tool designed to automate the search for domain transfers. It has an intuitive interface and few helpful shortcuts. As an input it expects a domain or list of domains. Ideally the list should be comma-separated but it will handle space or CR-LF separated lists as well. Aside from normal results it gives you a log of performed searches and all successful transfers are archived.
